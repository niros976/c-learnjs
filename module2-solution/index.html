<h1> Our Menu </h1>

<div>
	<div class="col-l-3"><section class="itemTitle" id="col1"> Chicken </section><p class="itemMessage"> Spacing: Pay attention to the spacing shown in the mockup illustrations. Note the spacing between sections (both horizontal and vertical). Note the horizontal spacing between the edges of the section and the edges of the browser window. Also, note the spacing between the dummy text in each section and the edges of the section. Lastly, make sure the dummy text is "pushed down" enough so it doesn't overlap the section title region. (Hint: use margins and padding and use border-box as your box-sizing as discussed in Lecture 19.) </p></div>
	<div class="col-l-3"><section class="itemTitle" id="col2"> Beef </section><p class="itemMessage"> Layout: In the mobile view (equal to or less than 767px), each section should take up the entire row. For a visual reference of this view, see the mobile mockup illustration below. </p></div>
	<div class="col-l-3 col-m-1"><section class="itemTitle" id="col3"> Sushi </section><p class="itemMessage"> Section title region: Each section should have a section title region that is always positioned at the top right corner of the section no matter the view (desktop, tablet or mobile). Copy the titles from the mockup illustration (i.e., Chicken, Beef, Sushi) or come up with your own. (Hint: use relative and absolute positioning and offsets as discussed in Lecture 22.) </p></div>
